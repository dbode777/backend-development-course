# backend-development-course

## Introduction
Work conducted for the CourseCareers courses. I'll use this repository to improve upon my skills as a software developer. The repository will be set up with branches that would reflect an industry-based workflow. This means there will be 2 protected branches for portions of the repository where these will be required (primarily for the backend development course). These will function as development/testing and production branches. Typically, most companies separate the development and testing branches, but since I will be the only person making changes to this repository, these can be merged into one branch.

For other portions of this repository (such as the API development sections of these courses), I will work to setup a YAML file that will deploy to a development/testing and production environment. For those sections of the courses, merging directly to the main branch is perfectly acceptable, as testing can be conducted once that step in the pipeline has been deployed. 

In the future, I may split up the work in these repositories if it makes more sense to separate the backend development work from the software fundamentals work. For a company, this is want I would do for the sake of organization and ownership; however, the coursework is already pretty condensed and as a lone developer, it will be easier to have everything in one repository.

## Background of Courses and Work Completed/To Be Completed
The first course, Software Development Fundamentals, is primarily used to both reinforce the skills I have already learned as an associate software developer, refine my habits as a developer as a whole, and learn optimal patterns to improve as a full-stack developer. Languages learned during this course included Javascript (Node.js and React.js), Typescript, Go, and HTML.

The second course, Backend Developement, specializes in (as the name suggests) backend development, along with some knowledge of frontend development and dev ops.
